# CCHS Analysis Tool
Create a dataset suitable for CCHS bootstrapping

# How it works
In order to calculate prevalence rates from the CCHS, a dataset must be created from the CCHS master with the correct dummy coding applied. This program and the attached macros provide a template for creating such a dataset after which bootstrapping can be executed. 

The program is made up of three steps. Step one is the selection of a CCHS indicator for analysis; step two is the selection of data years to include in the analysis; and step three involves computing the dummy coding for bootstrapping.
